## Description
The report shown is an analysis of AirBNB metrics in New York City, New York for the year 2019. Our purpose is to show different ways to improve listings on AirBNB and which are the most profitable listings.

The following data was used in the analysis.
- Owner information (name)
- Location information (neighborhood, longitude and latitude)
- Room information (type of listing, number of reviews per listing, availability, price
to rent for a day)

The data includes information from 48,896 listing for AirBNB in the New York area.

## Results
Some of the metrics that could be beneficial to perform a more detailed analysis would be to add the average length of stay, the average star rating of reviews, the profit per listing, and the average price per stay.

One recommendation to a potential client that was looking for a room/house to rent would be to look at Manhattan. Despite being more expensive it would be closer to all the major tourist attractions in the city. Due to the location, it would also be closer to where most of the sporting events would be as well as ease to get around to other cities where other events might possibly be. It is also where most of the entertainment is in the city.

Looking at one’s budget would be an important factor on where they should stay when visiting New York. If the client’s budget was on the higher end due to its location and proximity then Manhattan would be the most desirable location for one to stay, but if our client had a more frugal budget then I would recommend they stay in Brooklyn as its close to Manhattan while being a little less expensive.

Recommendations for listing owners
- Rent out entire home or apartment to increase the profit.
- To be able to raise the price you should consider renting in Manhattan. Real
estate price was not taken into consideration.
- It is recommended that you use words like room, bedroom, private, apartment,
cozy, and/or studio in your listing name.

## Requirements
- Python modules Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib.
- All the data files should be in the same directory as the main python file.t
